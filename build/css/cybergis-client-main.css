===========Description===========
The cybergis-client-main css file contains css to styles used throughout CyberGIS client applications.  It should come after regular OpenLayers, ExtJS, jQueryUI, and GeoExt css.  It should come before cybergis-client-openlayers and cybergis-client-geoext.

===========CyberGIS===========
The Humanitarian Information Unit has been developing a sophisticated geographic computing infrastructure referred to as the CyberGIS. The CyberGIS provides highly available, scalable, reliable, and timely geospatial services capable of supporting multiple concurrent projects.  The CyberGIS relies on primarily open source projects, such as PostGIS, GeoServer, GDAL, OGR, and OpenLayers.  The name CyberGIS is dervied from the term geospatial cyberinfrastructure.
